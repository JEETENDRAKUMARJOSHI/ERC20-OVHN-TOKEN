# ERC20-OVHN-TOKEN
First Project Created as ERC20 Token name VOH Coin
While Learn Solidity and completed the task to make ERC20 token name VOH Coin 

<h2>What is the ERC-20 Standard?</h2>
<p>
Tokens represent a wide range of digital assets in the Ethereum system, including vouchers, IOUs, and even real-world, actual things. Ethereum tokens are essentially smart contracts that run on the Ethereum network. ERC-20 is one such token that emerged as the trending standard for the majority of smart contracts. It enlists various rules and regulations that all ETH-based tokens have to follow. These include how token ownership can be transferred and how transactions are approved.

As a result, this token enables all sorts of developers to precisely forecast how future tokens will behave within the Ethereum system. This simplifies the process for developers since they can continue working knowing that no new projects will need to be performed every time a new token is published, as long as the token satisfies the rules. This compliance is also required since it assures that the many various Ethereum tokens are compatible. Now that we have brushed some basics regarding token standards, let us get into creating the ERC-20 contract.
